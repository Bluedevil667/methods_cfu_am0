# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- Very confident, they seem very straight foward and simple to use.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
-I feel great about them, I think that when it comes to more complex methods I get stuck, but only on synax that I have not learned yet. e.g the "+=" (I had to use for a couple of the assignments) 
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- How frequently are they used in the real world?
